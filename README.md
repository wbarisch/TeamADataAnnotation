This code was created with academic purposes.
It is part of a class project from the Technische Hochschule Ulm where students were prompted to test the viability of image recognition for catheter tip identification on fluoroscopy images.
The code simply converts the hdf5 file provided from the WEISS catheter dataset into .pmg image files.
